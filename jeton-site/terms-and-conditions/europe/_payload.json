Jeton reserves the right to charge You a chargeback fee as well additional fees in case Jeton has incurred any expenses in connection with a deposit method subject to a Chargeback.\n8.5.If a Chargeback or other transaction including deduction of fees pursuant to these Terms & Conditions results in a negative balance on Your Account, You agree such negative balance is repayable by You immediately without need for any notice to You by a deposit or transfer of funds to Your Jeton Account.

Jeton has the right to charge You fees and expenses that Jeton reasonably incurs in connection with debt collection and enforcement action.\n8.6.You must not deposit through a payment method if you are not the named holder of that payment method account.

Extra fees may be applied by Your bank or other banks to initiate the transaction independent of La Orange Limited or Financial House Limited.\n9. Send Money\n9.1You can send money (within the Limits of your Jeton Account) to other customers by providing the recipient’s mobile phone/ email or Customer ID number. They do not need to be existing customers of Jeton for You to send funds but they will need to set up a Jeton Account to receive and access these funds so You may wish to inform the recipient of this if they are not an existing customer. You must make sure that the information You enter is correct, as this information is used to facilitate the payment.\n9.2If You are asked to provide details of the recipient’s e-mail address or other means of identification, where applicable, You must take great care to provide the exact details of who You wish to send money to. Jeton uses those details as the unique identifier to determine the intended recipient of the payment.\n9.3If the e-mail address of the intended recipient is registered with Jeton, the funds will be sent to the recipient’s Jeton Account and if the ‘auto accept payments’ option is active, the amount will be deposited directly to the recipient’s Jeton Account immediately. If the auto accept payments’ option is deactivated, the recipient will need to manually accept, or reject the payment (in accordance with section 10). Once funds are credited to the recipient’s Jeton Account, the transaction becomes irreversible.\n9.4If the recipient’s e-mail address is not registered with Jeton, Jeton will send a notification e-mail to that e-mail address with instructions on how to receive the payment. If the recipient does not claim the payment within 10 days, the transaction will be cancelled, and the funds will be returned to You.\n9.5If you think a payment may have been made incorrectly or is unauthorised, you must inform Jeton as soon as possible. Further provisions relating to erroneous and unauthorised transactions are in section 18.\n9.6If Your Jeton Account balance is insufficient to cover the charges or fees, Jeton may refuse to execute a payment transaction. At Your request, We will provide you with the following information relating to each payment transaction:\n(a)the maximum execution time;\n(b)the charges payable by You in respect of the payment transaction; and\n(c)where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of such charges.\n9.7We will provide the following information to You, once a month, by email at no charge and in a manner which enables You to store and reproduce the information unchanged:\n(a)a reference enabling You to identify the payment transaction and, where appropriate, information relating to the payee;\n(b)the amount of the payment transaction in the currency in which the Your account is debited or in the currency used for the payment order;\n(c)the amount of any charges for the payment transaction and, where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of such charges, or the interest payable by You;\n(d)where applicable, the exchange rate used in the payment transaction and the amount of the payment transaction after that currency conversion; and\n(e)the debit value date or the date of receipt of the payment order.\n10. Receive Money\n10.1. By default, every Personal Account is set to the ‘auto accept payments’ option. This means that any received amount will be deposited directly to Your Jeton Account after deduction of any applicable fees. You may deactivate the ‘auto accepts payment option’ and must then manually accept or reject any transactions.\n10.2 You agree and acknowledge all receipts into Your Account are final and not reversible unless Jeton agrees to reverse a specific transfer following a lawful request by You or the sender or unless reversal is necessary to fulfil any obligation under these Terms & Conditions or applicable law.\n10.3.If You deactivate the ‘auto accept payments’ option and on receipt of funds into Your Jeton Account You do not take any action to manually accept or reject any transactions, any such transactions will be cancelled after 10 days. In such cases, the debited amount will be returned to the sender’s Jeton Account. During that 10 day period, the sender will be able to cancel the transaction. If cancelled, the recipient will be notified, and the funds will be returned to the sender’s Jeton Account.\n10.4.You will be notified by email and or text once You receive funds into Your Jeton Account. Any payments will be displayed in Your transaction history. You agree to regularly review all payments to ensure that they are accurate.\n10.5.If You wish the transaction to be completed in case the payments are refunded to the sender either due to cancellation or failure to manually accept the payment, You must contact the sender directly to repeat the transaction. Jeton is unable to resend a transaction that has been declined, cancelled, or expired.10.6.We will provide the following information to You, once a month, over email at no charge and in a manner which enables You to store and reproduce the information unchanged:(a)a reference enabling You to identify the payment transaction and the payer, and any information transferred with the payment transaction;\n(b)the amount of the payment transaction in the currency in which Your account is credited;\n(c)the amount of any charges for the payment transaction and, where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of such charges, or the interest payable by You;\n(d)where applicable, the exchange rate used in the payment transaction, and the amount of the payment transaction before that currency conversion; and\n(e)the credit value date.\n11. Withdraw Money\n11.1.The amount of money You can withdraw or redeem is limited to Your Limits and the current balance of Your Jeton Account excluding any fees owed to Jeton. Withdrawals are free of charge prior to termination of Your Jeton Account and for a period of up to one year following termination of Your Account.\n11.2.In order to make a withdrawal, You must log into Your Jeton Account, select a withdrawal method and enter the amount. Withdrawals rely partly on actions to be performed by third party financial institutions and therefore, Jeton cannot always guarantee the availability of any specific withdrawal method. Jeton reserves the right to make changes to the available withdrawal methods at any time without prior notice as long as there is at least one withdrawal option available to You, unless applicable law and regulation requires otherwise.\n11.3 Jeton shall not be liable for any delays in processing client withdrawal requests, as such requests are partly facilitated by third party financial institutions.\n11.4. You must not initiate a withdrawal to an account of which You are not the named account holder. Jeton takes any violation of this requirement extremely seriously and will treat any attempt to use an account of which You are not the named account holder as a fraudulent act. In case of a such attempt, Your Jeton Account can be suspended, cancelled and the balance of the account can be seized until an investigation concludes with this regard, without prejudice to claiming further loss.\n11.5You must ensure that the payment details You provide when withdrawing funds are correct and complete. If You have provided Jeton with inaccurate and/or incomplete details, Jeton will not be liable for withdrawn funds being sent to the wrong payment account.\n12. Termination and Deactivation of Your Jeton Account\n12.1.You may terminate Your Jeton Account by contacting Jeton’s Customer Support team via the Website. The relevant team will start the process based on Your request. This process may take up to 14 working days in the normal course of events and after that, Your Jeton Account will be terminated.
